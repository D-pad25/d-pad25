## 🚀 About Me

I'm a final-year Mechatronics & Business Management student passionate about solving real-world problems through intelligent systems. My work bridges mechanical design, AI, and software development — with hands-on experience across control systems, ROS, Python, MATLAB, and embedded systems.

I enjoy taking ideas from prototype to deployment, with a focus on:

- 🧠 Vision-Language-Action models for robotic manipulation
- 🌱 Autonomous agriculture (e.g., vertical farming, tree planting robots)
- 🧭 Navigation and control for mobile & aerial robots
- 📈 Strategy development, viability analysis, and commercialisation
