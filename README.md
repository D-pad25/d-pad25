## 🚀 About Me

I'm a final-year Mechatronics & Business Management student passionate about solving real-world problems through intelligent systems. My work bridges mechanical design, AI, and software development — with hands-on experience across control systems, ROS, Python, MATLAB, and embedded systems.

I enjoy taking ideas from prototype to deployment, with a focus on:

- 🧠 Vision-Language-Action models for robotic manipulation
- 🌱 Autonomous agriculture (e.g., vertical farming, tree planting robots)
- 🧭 Navigation and control for mobile & aerial robots
- 📈 Strategy development, viability analysis, and commercialisation

## 🧩 Current Projects

- 🌿 **AgriVLA** – Vision-Language-Action model for robotic harvesting in vertical farms  
- 🌳 **SPROUT** – Autonomous tree planting robot for steep terrain (TRL funding strategy, patent analysis)  
- 🛻 **Warehouse Navigation Robot** – A* and RRT* path planning, state machine navigation, and real-time control  
- 🎓 Honours Thesis under Dr. Chris Lehnert – Fusing deep learning and vision systems for agricultural automation
